CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and all transformations that I made in the data in order to fulfill the requirements

run_analysis.R gets and cleans the data and create tidy datasets that fulfill the requirements for the assessment:

Merges each pair of train and test datasets
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation of the measurement variables
Renames the labels with descriptive variable names
Creates a new tidy data set from the one in step 4, this time with mean of each measurement
Creates FinalData.txt: the ultimate dataset required by the assessment.
